plone.app.async is included in prod.cfg

collective.documentviewer uses it.
instance-async convert asynchronously files.
An async db has been added to store async information.
This avoids regular transactions (2 min) in main db.

Some views can be used to follow asynchronous batches.
* /manage-job-queue (from plone.app.async)
* /dvasync-monitor (from dv, more basic)

Problem with plone.app.async:
* a reindex of SearchableText is done. During this process, metadata are updated. getObjSize index method is called.
  This uses getObjSize script that is not accessible because acquisition and/or request is not available in async.
  Solution: own dms files index method to avoid plone script.
